Updated the code to work on the quest.
While testing it was facing issues to start the apk on the quest.
It was not loading the apk on the quest. 
It loaded the apk before adding the VR mode in player settings, and changing to auto manage. But then the buttons didn't work, only could see the scene.
When unticked "Auto-Manage", the scene doesn't load.
Couldn't figure out why this was happening, but once that is done, the code should work. 
In the code, if the devMode bool is checked, it uses the persistent path, if not then the user can provide the path to where the files are stored. 
If using persistent path, the user needs to manually store the files in the persistent path, this path will be displayed on screen when the scene loads. 
To not show logs on screen, simply comment out he handle Log code.
